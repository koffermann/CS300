<b><i> What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? </b></i>
<br> THe first problem that I was attempting to solve in this course involved finding out whether vector sorting, hash tables, or binary search trees were faster based on how quickly they handled a csv file of bids. With the two projects from this course, the first project involved choosing the fastest method, and the second project involved solving the problem of iterating through and printing courses with the best method chosen from project one.

<b><i> How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. </b></i>
<br> I approached the problem by putting more focus on pseduocodes rather than jumping straight into coding. It helped me to understand what the program was meant to do from beginning to end. Data structures are important to understand because a lack of understanding can be the difference between a fast, efficient piece of software and one that is too slow for users to rely on.

<b><i> How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? </b></i>
<br> When I encountered roadblocks, my most common solution was to return to zybooks, or read through the explanations of more experienced programmers on Stack Overflow. It also helped me a lot to examine the source code that was given to us with the bid-related assignments to have an idea of how the different codes are suppposed to look when they are finished.

<b><i> How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? </b></i>
<br> Before this class, I did not think much about how data structures can affect the speed of a program. Speed may not consequential when starting out as a new programmer, but everyone has been on the other end of a software or application that lagged so badly that it essentially ruined the experience of the system. In future software development courses--and later on when I find a career path in software development--I will think about the different data structures and how they play a key role in a program running smoothly.

<b><i> How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? </b></i>
<br> Honestly, before this project I never reused codes. I simply wrote what was needed for an assignment and saved it in a folder. After this project, though, I learned that writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code can be a lifesaver for programmers. It was fascinating to see how the source code we used through the assignments offered to much flexibility in terms of changing a data structure yet still performing the same tasks.
