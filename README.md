<b><i> What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? </b></i>
<br> THe first problem that I was attempting to solve in this course involved finding out whether vector sorting, hash tables, or binary search trees were faster based on how quickly they handled a csv file of bids. With the two projects from this course, the first project involved choosing the fastest method, and the second project involved solving the problem of iterating through and printing courses with the best method chosen from project one.

<b><i> How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. </b></i>
<br> I approached the problem by putting more focus on pseduocodes rather than jumping straight into coding. It helped me to understand what the program was meant to do from beginning to end. Data structures are important to understand because a lack of understanding can be the difference between a fast, efficient piece of software and one that is too slow for users to rely on.
